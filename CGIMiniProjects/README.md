## Notes
* index.html is the main opening page that all users see, that hosts the links to all the projects.
* Project_Sources.html hosts the download links for all the example files in the Examples folder.
* The upload folder is where all verified files from the user get uploaded to.
* Temperature.php is the **Local weather project. It is standalone.**
* project2.html is the **Zipcode Analyzer Program**. It accesses the CGI files **project2.cgi** and **project2.java** to verify the files being uploaded and to process the files.
* upload.html is the **Student Grades Program**. It uses **upload_file.php** to verify the file being uploaded and to process it.

All files relating to project 3 are related to a project I decided not to release, the Painter Bucket Algorithm. It accepts a special gruop of characters and performs a paint bucket algorithm onto it. I decided to keep it in the github in case you want to see, but left it out due to lack of examples and its complexity.
