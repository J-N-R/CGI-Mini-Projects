## Notes
 * To keep the files clean, I removed the executable files. If you would like to run this on your own system, you have to download the files and compile them one by one.
 * project2.cgi is a python program. The extension was renamed to CGI as per the project requirements to show that by including #! in a unix file, you can tell the bash shell which program can run it, allowing you to rename the extension to whatever you want.
